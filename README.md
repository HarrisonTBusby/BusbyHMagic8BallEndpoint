# BusbyHMagic8BallEndpoint

This program takes a userInputted response in the URL and then using a randomizer connected to a string array, the terminal spits out a response.

 Peer Review: Reed Goodwin- This is a truly well functioning 8ball that works just as a 8ball should, you input you question or phrase and it drops your fate! Code is clean. Good job Harrison :)
